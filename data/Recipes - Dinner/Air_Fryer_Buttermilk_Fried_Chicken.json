Pour the crumbs into a shallow bowl. (if you don't have a food processor, you can crush the cornflakes in a plastic bag with a rolling pin.)",

        "Turn the chicken pieces. Air fry for an additional 7–10 minutes or until the chicken is done and a meat thermometer inserted in the center registers 165°F."
