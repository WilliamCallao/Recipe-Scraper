    "instructions": [
        "Prepare & roast the vegetables: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Fill a small pot 3/4 of the way up with water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Fill a separate, medium pot 3/4 of the way up with  water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into small florets. Halve, peel, and thinly slice the onion. Place the prepared vegetables on a sheet pan. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and season with salt (optional), pepper, and the za’atar; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 20 to 22 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Prepare the remaining ingredients: Meanwhile, halve the lemon; squeeze the juice into a medium bowl, straining out the seeds. Peel 1 clove of garlic; using a zester, finely grate into a paste (or use the small side of a box grater). Pick the mint leaves off the stems.",
        "Cook the pasta: Place the pasta in a strainer and thoroughly rinse under cold water to remove any excess starch. Transfer to the medium pot of boiling water. Cook, uncovered, 7 to 8 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.",
        "Cook & slice the eggs: Meanwhile, carefully add the eggs to the small pot of boiling water and cook 9 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. When cool enough to handle, peel the cooked eggs. Transfer to a cutting board and thinly slice into rounds.",
        "Make the dressing: Meanwhile, to the bowl of lemon juice, add the tahini, 2 tablespoons of water, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and as much of the garlic paste as you’d like. Whisk until combined and smooth.",
        "Finish & serve your dish: To the pot of cooked pasta, add the roasted vegetables, almonds , cheese, dressing, and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Stir to combine. Serve the finished pasta topped with the sliced eggs. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and garnish with the mint leaves (tearing just before adding). Enjoy!"
