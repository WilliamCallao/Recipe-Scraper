        "Put the whole sweet potatoes in a large saucepan and add enough cold water to cover. Bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 30â€“35 minutes. Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water until they're easy to handle.",
        "Meanwhile, warm the oil in a small saucepan over high heat until warm, about 1 minute. (Or microwave the oil in a microwavable bowl on high until the oil is warm, about 30 seconds.) Add the mint leaves and crush with the handle of a wooden spoon or a pestle. Set aside.",
        "Peel the sweet potatoes and return them to the saucepan. Add the mint mixture, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher until smooth and creamy. Transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl, garnish with the mint sprigs, and serve hot."
