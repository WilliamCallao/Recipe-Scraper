        "Preheat the oven to 425ºF.",
        "Make the crust: in a bowl, combine the graham-cracker crumbs, maple syrup, oil, egg white, crystallized ginger, and 1/2 tsp of the ground ginger. Press into a 9-inch, nonstick pie pan, to form an even crust. Set aside.",
        "In a small bowl, mix together the Splenda, cinnamon, the other 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, cloves, and salt.",
        "In another bowl, beat the eggs and vanilla together. Add in the Splenda mixture and stir to combine.",
        "Add in the pumpkin and stir until the mixture is well blended. Dissolve the corn starch in about 2 to 3 Tbsp. of the evaporated milk. Add the corn starch mixture and the remaining evaporated milk to the pumpkin mixture, and mix until smooth. The mixture will be thin.",
        "Pour the pumpkin pie filling into the prepared crust. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes at 425°F. Lower the heat to 350°F, and bake an additional 40 minutes, or until the filling is set when a knife inserted comes out clean.",
        "Remove the pie from the oven, and let cool for 2 hours before serving. Cut into 8 wedges. Top each slice with 1 tbsp whipped topping right before serving."
