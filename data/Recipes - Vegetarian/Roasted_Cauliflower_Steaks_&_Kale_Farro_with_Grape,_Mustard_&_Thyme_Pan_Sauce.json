        "Prepare & roast the cauliflower: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450Â°F. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Remove the leaves of the cauliflower; cut lengthwise through the stem into 1-inch-thick steaks (keeping them as intact as possible). Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and season with white pepper, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves; gently turn to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 25 to 27 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Cook the farro:  Meanwhile, add the farro to the pot of boiling water. Cook, uncovered, 18 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.",
        "Prepare the remaining ingredients: Meanwhile, separate the kale leaves from the stems; discard the stems, then roughly chop the leaves. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Halve the grapes. Pick the thyme leaves off the stems (you should have about 1 tbsp of leaves). Peel and medium dice the shallot.",
        "Cook the kale: In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped kale; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the water has cooked off and the kale is wilted. Add the vinegar. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the liquid has cooked off. Transfer to a bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Make the pan sauce & serve your dish:  In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the halved grapes and chopped shallot. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the thyme leaves, mustard, and 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally and smashing the grapes with the back of a spoon, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thickened. Turn off the heat. To the pot of cooked farro, and the cooked kale, fromage blanc, and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Stir to combine. Serve the finished farro topped with the roasted cauliflower and pan sauce. Garnish with the almonds. Enjoy!"
