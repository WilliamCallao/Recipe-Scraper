        "Soak the artichokes in water to clean. Drain and repeat until the water is clear. Peel away the outside leaves of the bottom half of the artichokes, then cut off the top quarter of the artichokes. If tough, dark-green leaves remain, peel those as well. At this point, the artichoke should look like a flower, and the tough, dark leaves should all be removed, leaving only lighter-colored, more tender leaves.",
        "Add the juice of 1 lemon to a bowl full of cold water, then place the artichokes in the lemon water to prevent discoloration.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Remove the artichokes from the bowl, discarding the lemon water, and add them to the pot.",
        "Bring the water back to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain the artichokes and set aside.",
        "Place the remaining lemon juice, the olive oil, and mustard in a blender. Blend together to form a vinaigrette.",
        "Stir in the pepper, mint, dill, and parsley, and pour the dressing over the artichokes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
