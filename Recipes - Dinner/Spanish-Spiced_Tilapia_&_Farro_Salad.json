    "instructions": [
        "Cook the farro: Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the farro and cook, uncovered, 18 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly.",
        "Prepare the ingredients: Meanwhile, wash and dry fresh produce. Halve, peel, and medium dice the onion. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the green beans; halve crosswise. Peel and medium dice the orange. Pit and roughly chop the olives. Roughly chop the peppers.",
        "Cook the green beans: In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the halved green beans and half the diced onion in an even layer; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned. Add 2 tablespoons of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the green beans are softened and the liquid has cooked off. Transfer to a large bowl; cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the fish: Combine the spices (paprika, cumin, coriander, oregano, cayenne, and cinnamon) in a small bowl. Pat the fish dry with paper towels; season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fish. Cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until lightly browned and cooked through.* Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate. * An instant-read thermometer should register 145Â°F.",
        "Make the pan sauce & serve your dish: Add the remaining diced onion and 1 teaspoon of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook on medium-high, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Add the raisins, diced orange, and 2 tablespoons of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any fond, 2 to 3 minutes, or until combined and most of the liquid has cooked off. Turn off the heat. To the bowl of cooked green beans, add the cooked farro, chopped olives, chopped peppers, and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Season with salt (optional) and pepper; stir to combine. Serve the finished farro topped with the cooked fish and pan sauce. Enjoy!"
