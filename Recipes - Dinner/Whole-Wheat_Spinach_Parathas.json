        "Remove from the skillet. Repeat the cooking process with the remaining pieces of dough and remaining oil. Serve hot.",
        "Turn the paratha. Brush with  ¼ tsp of the remaining oil. Continue cooking for about 3–4 minutes per side, turning as necessary, until the edges are brown on both sides. Using a flat spatula, press the middle of the paratha as it’s cooking so it cooks evenly.",
        "Preheat a cast iron griddle or  flat skillet over medium-high heat. Place one piece of dough in the skillet. Cook for about 1 minute,  or until it begins to bubble.",
        "After the standing time, knead  the dough once again. Shape into 8 balls. Lightly dust your work  surface with the remaining 1 Tbsp flour. Using a rolling pin, flatten  each dough ball so it’s 6 inches  in diameter.",
        "To make the dough for the paratha: mix 2 cups flour and the remaining ¼ tsp salt in a shallow dish. Add the spinach mixture to the flour mixture. Add water, little by little, to form a smooth dough  (similar to the consistency of a pizza dough). Knead the dough until smooth. Transfer to a glass bowl. Cover with a damp towel. Set  aside for 30 minutes to an hour  at room temperature.",
        "Add the spinach and ¼ tsp salt. Cook for 3 minutes, or until the moisture released from the spinach is absorbed and the base becomes dry. Add the amchoor powder and cumin, stirring well. Remove from the heat. Set aside to cool.",
        "In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat 1 tsp oil over medium-high heat.  Add the ajwain seeds, gingerroot, and chile. Cook for about 1 minute, stirring frequently."
