        "Cook the barley:  Fill a large pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the barley. Cook, uncovered, 28 to 30 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.",
        "Prepare the ingredients:  Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores. Halve lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Halve the tomatoes; place in a medium bowl and season with salt (optional) and pepper. Combine the chile powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and oregano in a small bowl.",
        "Cook the peppers & finish the vegetables: In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced peppers; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped garlic and sliced white bottoms of the scallions. Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to the bowl of seasoned tomatoes. Cover to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the pork: Pat the pork dry with paper towels. Season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In the same pan, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned pork. Cook 4 to 6 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.* Transfer to a cutting board. Let rest at least 5 minutes. *An instant-read thermometer should register 145Â°F.",
        "Finish the barley & serve your dish: To the pot of cooked barley, add the finished vegetables, tomatillo-poblano sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Slice the rested pork crosswise. Serve the sliced pork over the finished barley. Garnish with the cheese and sliced green tops of the scallions. Enjoy!"
