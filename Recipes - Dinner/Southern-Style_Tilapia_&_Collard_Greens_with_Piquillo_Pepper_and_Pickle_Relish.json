        "Prepare the ingredients & make the relish:  Wash and dry the fresh produce. Halve, peel, and thinly slice the onion. Grate the apple on the large side of a box grater, discarding the core. Separate the collard green leaves from the stems; discard the stems, then roughly chop the leaves. Roughly chop the pickle chips and peppers; combine in a bowl. Combine the paprika, mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, thyme, and cayenne in a small bowl.",
        "Braise the apple & collard greens:  In a medium pot, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced onion; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the grated apple and chopped collard greens. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the collard greens are slightly softened. Add the vinegar and 1/2 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 9 to 11 minutes, or until the collard greens are softened and the water has cooked off. Turn off the heat. Cover to keep warm.",
        "Coat the fish:  Meanwhile, place the cornmeal on a large plate; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Place the buttermilk in a large bowl. Pat the fish dry with paper towels. Season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and the spice blend (you may have extra). Working one piece at a time, thoroughly coat the seasoned fish in the buttermilk (letting the excess drip off), then in the seasoned cornmeal (pressing to adhere). Transfer to a plate.",
        "Cook the fish & serve your dish:  In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the coated fish. Cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through.* Turn off the heat. Serve the cooked fish over the braised apple and collard greens. Garnish with the relish and fromage blanc. Enjoy! * An instant-read thermometer should register 145Â°F."
