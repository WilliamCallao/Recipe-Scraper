        "Prepare & roast the vegetables: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450Â°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stems of the sweet peppers; remove the cores, then quarter lengthwise. Medium dice the sweet potato. Combine the chile powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and oregano in a small bowl. Place the prepared vegetables on a sheet pan. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and season with salt (optional), pepper, and half the spice blend; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 17 to 19 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Prepare the salad ingredients:  Meanwhile, roughly chop the lettuce. Halve the tomatoes. Roughly chop the piquante peppers. Peel and medium dice the orange. Combine in a large bowl.",
        "Cook the beef: Separate the beef; pat dry with paper towels. Place in a bowl; season with salt (optional), pepper, and the remaining spice blend. Toss to coat. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned beef in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned and just cooked through. Turn off the heat.",
        "Make the dressing: Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the cilantro sauce and fromage blanc.",
        "Make the salad & serve your dish: To the bowl of prepared salad ingredients, add the roasted vegetables and dressing; toss to coat. Serve the salad topped with the cooked beef. Enjoy!"
