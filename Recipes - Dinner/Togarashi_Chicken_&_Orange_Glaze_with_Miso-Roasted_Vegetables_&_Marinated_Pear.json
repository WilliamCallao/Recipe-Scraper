        "Prepare the ingredients & marinate the pear: Remove the honey from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the green beans; halve crosswise. Cut the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Peel the carrots and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Cut out and discard the core of the cabbage; medium dice the leaves. Combine in a large bowl. Halve the orange crosswise; squeeze the juice into a separate bowl. Grate the pear on the large side of a box grater, discarding the core. In a large bowl, whisk together the mirin, sesame oil, and honey (kneading the packet before opening); season with salt and pepper. Add the grated pear and toss to coat. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes.",
        "Roast the vegetables: Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the miso paste, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of warm water. Divide the prepared vegetables between 2 sheet pans. Evenly top the vegetables with the miso mixture. Toss to thoroughly coat and arrange in an even layer. Roast 14 to 16 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Cook & glaze the chicken: Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the togarashi to coat (you may have extra). In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes, or until browned. Flip and cook 4 minutes. Add the orange juice (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, frequently spooning the juice over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked through(An instant-read thermometer should register 165°F). Transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board.",
        "Slice the chicken & serve your dish: Slice the glazed chicken crosswise. Serve the roasted vegetables topped with the sliced chicken and marinated pear (including any liquid). Enjoy!"
