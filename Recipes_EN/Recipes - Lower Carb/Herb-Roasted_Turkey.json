        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large roasting pan with foil. Set a rack inside the roasting pan and coat it with cooking spray. Set aside.",
        "In a small bowl, combine the butter with 2 Tsps.. each of the sage, thyme, and rosemary, plus salt and pepper. Reserve the remaining 1 Tsp. of each of the herbs.",
        "In a small saucepan, combine the chicken broth and wine, and bring to a gentle boil. Add the reserved herbs and lower to a simmer.",
        "With your hands, separate the turkey breast skin from the breast meat, creating a pocket without removing the skin. Rube the butter herb mixture all over the breast meat. Place the skin back down on the breast.",
        "Set the turkey on the prepared rack in the pan. (You can also add veggies like peeled carrots, peeled parsnips, onions, or small potatoes to the pan; they will cook along with the turkey.) Roast the turkey for about 1 hour, 20 minutes to 1 hour, 40 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F and the juices run clear. Baste every 15-20 minutes with the mixture of chicken broth and white wine.",
        "Remove the turkey from the oven, cover loosely with foil, and let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Discard the skin and serve."
