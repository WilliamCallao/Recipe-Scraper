        "Fill a soup pot with 1 inch water; place squash in water. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, and cook 25 to 30 minutes or until tender when pierced with a knife. Remove squash to a cutting board and allow to cool slightly. Cut squash in half, lengthwise. Remove and discard seeds with a spoon. With a fork, scrape the inside of one half, shredding it into noodle-like strands. Place shredded squash in a large bowl. Reserve remaining half for later use.",
        "Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium-low heat, heat oil until hot. Cook onion and garlic 3 to 4 minutes or until softened, stirring occasionally; add to squash.",
        "Add cream cheese to squash mixture and mix until thoroughly combined. Stir in egg, poultry seasoning, and pepper.",
        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat 1 (24-cup) mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Spoon equal amounts of squash mixture into each muffin cup and lightly press 2 to 3 dried cranberries on top of each. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Let cool slightly, then remove from muffin tin and serve."
