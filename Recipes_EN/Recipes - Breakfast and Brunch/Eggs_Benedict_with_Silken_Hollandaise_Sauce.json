        "Meanwhile, top each toasted muffin half with a ham slice, then a poached egg. Top each with about 3 tablespoons of the hot silken hollandaise sauce and serve.",
        "Fresh Fact: To poach eggs, bring about 3 inches of water to boil in a large, shallow skillet over high heat. Turn off the heat and add eggs at once by breaking them directly into the water. Immediately cover pan with a tight-fitting lid. Allow eggs to cook undisturbed until done as desired, about 4 minutes. Remove the eggs with a perforated spatula or large slotted spoon and drain on paper towels."
