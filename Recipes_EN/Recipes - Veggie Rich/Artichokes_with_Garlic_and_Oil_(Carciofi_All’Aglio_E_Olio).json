        "Soak the artichokes in water to clean; drain and repeat until water is clear. Peel away the outside leaves of the bottom half of the artichokes. Cut off the top quarter of the artichoke (at this point the artichoke should look like a flower, and the tough, dark leaves should all be removed, leaving only lighter-colored, tenderer leaves). If tough, dark green leaves remain, peel those as well. Add juice of 1 lemon to a bowl full of cold water, and place cleaned artichokes inside to avoid discoloration.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add cleaned artichokes. Bring back to a boil on high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer artichokes 25–30 minutes, or until tender. Drain artichokes well, pat dry with a paper towel, and set aside.",
        "In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until garlic begins to release its aroma, approximately 1 minute. Add artichokes, turn to coat in oil, and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red chile flakes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve warm."
