        "To make the teriyaki sauce:Heat 1 tsp. sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring frequently until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in water, soy sauce, sweetener, and vinegar and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil, stirring occasionally until reduced by half, about 8–10 minutes. Stir in sesame seeds and arrowroot and cook until thick, about 1–3 minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "To assemble:Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss broccoli, peppers, carrots, and 2 tsp. sesame oil together until well coated. Arrange vegetables in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes.",
        "Arrange salmon fillets in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Brush 1 tablespoon of teriyaki sauce over each salmon fillet. Continue to bake until salmon reaches desired doneness and vegetables are tender, about 8–10 minutes. Drizzle remaining teriyaki over vegetables. Top with green onions and serve."
