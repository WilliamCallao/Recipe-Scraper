        "In a large saucepan, stir together ½ cup broth, the leeks, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Remove from the heat. Let cool for 5 minutes.",
        "In a food processor or blender (vent the blender lid), process the leek mixture for about 1 minute, or until smooth. Return the leek mixture to the pan. Keep warm over low heat (uncovered).",
        "Fill a small saucepan half-full with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium high. Cut a small X on the bottom of each tomato so the skin will loosen more easily. Put 2 tomatoes in the saucepan. Simmer for 10 seconds, or until the peel starts to loosen from the flesh. Transfer to a cutting board. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes.Let the tomatoes cool for a few minutes, then remove the peel. Cut the tomatoes into four wedges each.",
        "In a food processor or blender, process the tomatoes and the remaining ½ cup broth in batches until smooth, about 1 minute per batch. Before processing the last batch, add the basil.",
        "Stir the tomato mixture into the leek mixture. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "Stir in the half-and-half. Cook over low heat for 1–2 minutes, or until the soup is heated through, stirring occasionally. Serve warm or refrigerate in an airtight container until chilled."
