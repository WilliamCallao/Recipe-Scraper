        "Pierce the squash over the entire surface with the tip of a sharp knife. Place in the microwave and set on high for 2 minutes. Using 2 dish towels or pot holders, carefully remove the squash from the microwave (it will be hot). Cut the squash in half crosswise, not lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds and connecting strands with a spoon.",
        "Place the water and a trivet in the Instant Pot. Place the 2 squash halves on the trivet. Seal the lid, close the valve, and set the Manual/Pressure Cook button to 7 minutes.",
        "Use a quick pressure release. Meanwhile, combine the soy sauce, juice of 1 of the limes, sugar, ginger, and crushed pepper flakes in a small bowl. Whisk until well blended and set aside.",
        "When the valve drops, carefully remove the lid. Remove the squash halves and place on a cutting board. Remove the trivet.",
        "Press the Cancel button and set to Sauté. Then press the Adjust button to “More” or “High.” Add the edamame to the water, bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes. Drain well.",
        "To create long spaghetti squash strands, run a fork around the outer edges of the squash to release the strands, rather than “raking through” the strands.",
        "Place the squash in a large serving bowl or divide among 6 individual bowls. Top the squash evenly with the edamame, carrots, and green onion, spoon the soy sauce mixture evenly over all, and sprinkle with the nuts and cilantro. Do not stir. Cut the remaining lime into 6 wedges and serve with the squash to squeeze over all."
