        "Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the canola oil, brown sugar blend, and sunflower butter until smooth. Set aside.",
        "Coat a medium saucepan with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat. Add the oats, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and flaxseed and toast until slightly brown and fragrant, stirring regularly, about 5 minutes. Remove the toasted oat mixture from the saucepan and place in a small bowl.",
        "Add the oil mixture into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Then quickly turn the heat to low and whisk regularly, until the mixture has slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Remove the saucepan from the heat and then add the toasted oat mixture. Stir to evenly coat.",
        "Spread the oat mixture in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Wipe the saucepan clean with a paper towel.",
        "In a medium bowl, whisk together the water, lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add the apples and toss to evenly coat.",
        "In the same saucepan, heat the butter over a medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the apple mixture and cook until the apples have slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to slightly cool.",
        "While the apples are cooking, mix the yogurt and lemon zest together in a small bowl. In each of 4 parfait glasses, layer 1/4 cup of the yogurt, 1/3 cup of the apple mixture, another 1/4 cup of yogurt, and top with 1/4 cup of the granola.*",
        "*Chef's note: The parfaits can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Store the granola separately and add just before eating."
