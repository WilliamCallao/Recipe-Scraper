        "To poach eggs, bring about 3 inches of water to boil in a large, shallow skillet over high heat. Turn off the heat and add eggs at once by breaking them directly into the water. Immediately cover pan with a tight-fitting lid. Allow eggs to cook undisturbed until done as desired, about 4 minutes. Remove the eggs with a perforated spatula or large slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.",
        "Add the cooking spray and oil to a sauté pan over medium heat. Sauté the spinach until wilted. Stir in the garlic and sauté 1 additional minute.",
        "Prepare a double boiler with a heat-proof bowl. Add the egg yolk, lemon juice, and vegetable broth, whisking constantly until hot but not curdled. Remove from heat and whisk in yogurt, salt (optional), and pepper.",
        "Top each English muffin half with 1/4 of spinach mixture, one poached egg, and 2 Tbsps. sauce."
