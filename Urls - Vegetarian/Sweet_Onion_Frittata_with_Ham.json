        "Place a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray, add ham, and cook until beginning to lightly brown, about 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from skillet and set aside on separate plate.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium, coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray, add onions, and cook 4 minutes or until beginning to turn golden, stirring frequently.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium low, add ham to the onions, and cook 1 minute (this allows the flavors to blend and the skillet to cool slightly before the eggs are added). Pour egg substitute evenly over all, cover and cook 8 minutes or until puffy and set.",
        "Remove the skillet from the heat, sprinkle cheese evenly over all, cover and let stand 3 minutes to melt the cheese and develop flavors."
