        "Preheat oven to 425°F. Use 1 Tbsp olive oil to grease the bottom of a large roasting pan.",
        "Pat the turkey breast dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. Place turkey breast skin side up in the pan. Brush the turkey with the remaining olive oil. Sprinkle Herbes de Provence and poultry seasoning on turkey, and rub into skin with your hands. Place whole garlic head, 1 lemon half, rosemary, thyme, and sage in the pan. Squeeze lemon juice from remaining lemon half over the top of the turkey.",
        "Place turkey in the oven, add a cup of water to the bottom of the pan, and roast for 1 hour, uncovered. Baste turkey after the first hour of cooking. If turkey looks very brown, cover it with foil. Continue to bake for another 30-45 minutes or until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the turkey breast reads 180°F on a meat thermometer. Remove from the oven, and place on a carving board. Let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Remove skin while carving.",
        "Strain the liquid from the bottom of the pan into another saucepan. Juice the remaining 2 lemon halves, add to the saucepan, and stir. Bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for 10 minutes or until sauce has reduced. Taste, and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve sauce in a gravy boat next to turkey."
