        "Start the timer then turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a gentle simmer and simmer until the timer goes off.",
        "When the timer goes off, immediately drain the water from the pan then gently shake the eggs in the pan to crack the shells.",
        "Cover in ice water and let sit in the ice water for 15 minutes.",
        "Drain the ice water, then gently roll each egg on a paper towel to loosen the shell, and peel the shell off of the egg.",
        "Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week."
