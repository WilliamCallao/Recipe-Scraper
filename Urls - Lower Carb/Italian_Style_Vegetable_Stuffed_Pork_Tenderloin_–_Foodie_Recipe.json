        "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a small baking sheet with cooking spray. Set aside.",
        "Add olive oil to a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini, bell pepper, onion and dried Italian seasoning and sauté for 5-7 minutes or until vegetables are softened. Add garlic and sauté another minute. Set aside. (This should result in about 3/4 cup of filling.)",
        "Insert a long, thin knife into the center of one end of the pork loin; repeat this process at the other end. After cutting with the knife, use the handle of a long wooden spoon to make sure the incision goes all the way through the pork tenderloin and move it back and forth to make the hole big enough to hold the stuffing.",
        "Fill the hole with all of the stuffing, using a spoon to ensure the stuffing goes all the way through the tenderloin.",
        "In a small bowl, mix the paprika, garlic powder, salt (optional) and black pepper. Rub the seasoning all over the pork tenderloin. Place on the baking sheet, spray the pork lightly with cooking spray and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the internal temperature of the pork is 145 degrees.",
        "Remove from the oven and allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before slicing."
