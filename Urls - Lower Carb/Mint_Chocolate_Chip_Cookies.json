        "Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed with a spatula. On slow speed, add the flour mixture into the pudding mixture and mix until well combined, but do not over-mix. Fold in the chocolate chips.",
        "Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, drop spoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Press down slightly as the cookies do not spread very much while baking (should be about ½\" thick).",
        "Bake for 10 minutes or until just slightly browned on the edges. Cool on rack for 1 minute and then move to a wire cooling rack. Enjoy!"
