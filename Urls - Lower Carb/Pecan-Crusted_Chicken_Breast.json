        "Place the chicken on the baking sheet. In a small bowl, stir together the applesauce and mustard. Spoon the applesauce-mustard mixture on top of each breast, spreading it evenly with the back of the spoon. Firmly press the applesauce-mustard side of each chicken breast into the pecans. Place the chicken back on the baking sheet, pecan-crusted side up. Sprinkle any remaining pecans on the chicken; press to adhere. Sprinkle with salt.",
        "Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165° F. Divide among four dinner plates and serve."
