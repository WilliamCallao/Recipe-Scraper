        "Coat a sauté pan with cooking spray over medium heat. Sauté the kale and onions until the onions are just cooked through, about 5-6 minutes. Add the salt (optional), Herbs d’Provence, and turkey sausage. Set aside to cool.",
        "Once the vegetables and meat are cool, stir in the egg substitute and set aside.",
        "In a clean bowl, combine the egg whites and cream of tartar. Using an electric mixer, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks.",
        "Gently fold the egg whites into the egg and vegetable mixture, and pour it into a 2 1/2 quart round baking dish. (You can also use an 8-inch square dish. Be sure not to coat baking dish with cooking spray or the soufflé will not rise.)",
        "Bake for 30 minutes. Cut the soufflé into four equal pieces and serve immediately.",
        "Note: The soufflé will fall a little once removed from the oven, this is normal."
