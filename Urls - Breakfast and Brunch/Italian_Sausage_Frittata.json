        "Pour egg mixture into the skillet and gently stir vegetables to make sure the egg mixture spreads throughout the pan. Press the sausage and vegetables into the egg mixture. Turn the heat to low and cook 10 minutes. Frittata will be mostly cooked through.",
        "Place the frittata under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes to brown. Watch to make sure the top doesn’t brown too much.",
        "To serve, loosen frittata around edges, cut in half, and slip each half onto an individual plate."
