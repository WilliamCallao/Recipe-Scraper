        "Cut pork loin into 1-inch cubes. Place in a resealable plastic bag set in a shallow dish. In a small bowl combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, lemon zest, cumin and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Pour half of the olive oil mixture over meat (reserve remaining half). Seal bag; turn to coat meat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning bag occasionally.",
        "Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook and stir 6 to 8 minutes or until tender. Add stock and bring to a boil. Add sorghum. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 45 to 60 minutes or until the sorghum is tender, stirring occasionally.",
        "Preheat oven to 400°F. Arrange chickpeas on a foil-lined 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Drizzle with reserved olive oil mixture; toss to coat. Roast in preheated oven 20 to 30 minutes or until chickpeas are toasted and crispy, stirring occasionally. Remove from oven and set oven temperature to 500°F.",
        "Drain meat, discarding marinade. Divide meat amongst 6 wooden or metal skewers. Arrange skewers on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes or until meat is slightly pink in the center, turning once halfway through.",
        "To serve, divide cooked sorghum between 6 shallow bowls. Top with tomatoes, arugula, cucumber, feta cheese, olives, chickpeas and Red Lentil Hummus. Serve with pork skewers."
