        "In a separate small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, garlic powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, and salt. Drizzle the olive oil over the potatoes and toss to combine. Sprinkle the cornstarch mixture over the potatoes and toss until evenly coated. Transfer to the sheet tray and arrange the potatoes into a single layer, spacing them out as best as possible. If needed, use a second tray (this will give you crispier fries).",
        "Bake for 12 minutes. Use a spatula to flip the potatoes",
        "Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve hot."
