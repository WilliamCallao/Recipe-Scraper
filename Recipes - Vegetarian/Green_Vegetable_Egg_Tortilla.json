        "Preheat an ovenproof nonstick pan over medium heat. Add vegetables from the bowl and sauté until ingredients are cooked through, about 2 minutes.",
        "Add milk to the bowl with whisked eggs and whisk briefly to combine. Add egg mixture to pan and stir with a wooden or plastic spoon. Make sure all ingredients are evenly spread out.",
        "Place pan in the middle rack of your oven and cook for 10 minutes. To check if the tortilla (egg and vegetable mixture) is done, insert a toothpick in the middle; if it comes out clean, the tortilla is cooked through.",
        "Remove from oven and let it rest on the stovetop for 1-2 minutes so eggs settle and don’t fall apart when serving. Enjoy!"
