        "Prepare the ingredients: Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then thinly slice lengthwise. Peel and thinly slice the shallot. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic.",
        "Cook the pasta: Add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Turn off the heat. Reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly and rinse under cold water to prevent sticking. Return to the pot.",
        "Cook the vegetables & make the sauce: Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the mushroom pieces in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sliced peppers, sliced shallot, capers, and chopped garlic; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the tomato paste and chile paste. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Add 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the liquid is slightly reduced in volume. Turn off the heat. Stir in the spinach until wilted and combined.",
        "Finish & serve your dish: To the pot of cooked pasta, add the cooked vegetables and sauce and half the reserved pasta cooking water. Cook on medium-high, stirring gently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pasta is coated (if necessary, gradually add the remaining cooking water to ensure the pasta is thoroughly coated). Turn off the heat. Stir in the mascarpone until combined. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Enjoy!"
