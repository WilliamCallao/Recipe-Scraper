        "For the sweet chili sauce: Pour water and vinegar into a saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and stir in 1/2 cup sweetener, ketchup, 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, garlic, and chili pepper; reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes.",
        "Add cornstarch to a small bowl and mix with 2 tablespoons cold water until smooth. Whisk cornstarch mixture into Sweet Chili Sauce. Bring mixture back to a low boil while stirring, then remove from heat. Pour into a bowl or jar. Sauce will thicken even more as it cools. Refrigerate until serving with the Thai Spring Rolls.",
        "For the Thai Spring Rolls: In a skillet sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and heated to medium, add shredded cabbage, carrots, and green onion. Add 2 tsps. sweetener, soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp. ginger. Sauté just until wilted, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.",
        "Spray your air-fryer with nonstick cooking spray and heat to 390º. While your air fryer is preheating, prepare your Thai Spring Rolls. Lay out a single egg roll wrapper, so it looks like a diamond shape facing you. Scoop about 4 tablespoons of filling into the center of the wrapper. Fold the lower half over the filling, and then pull in the two corners at the same time. Roll it away from you, so it makes a baton-like shape. Take a little water to seal it if needed. Repeat for the rest of the rolls.",
        "Place Thai Spring Rolls into air fryer, 3 at a time, and give them a light coating of cooking spray. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes, turning over halfway through cooking.",
        "Remove and let cool slightly. Repeat for the second batch. Serve alongside Sweet Chili Sauce and enjoy."
