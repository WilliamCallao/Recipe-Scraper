        "Add 1 1/2 cups of the beans to a large bowl with the onions. With a fork or potato masher, mash until mostly smooth (will be slightly chunky from onions). Note: If you have a food processor, you can blend until smooth then put in a bowl.",
        "Add the remaining beans, the cooked grain, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Stir until well combined.",
        "Form bean mixture into 8, 1/2-inch thick patties.",
        "Add cooking spray to a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add bean patties and cook about 2-3 minutes per side, until slightly brown. Work in batches if your pan is not big enough to hold all 8 burgers.",
        "Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or wrap individually in freezer bags or containers and freeze up to 6 months (freeze cooked burgers only, do not freeze the raw burgers)."
