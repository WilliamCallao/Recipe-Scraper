Remove the mixture from the pan and set aside in a bowl.",

Mix the two types of cheese together and spread 1/4 cup cheese over the spinach-mushroom mixture. Fold the tortilla in half. Cook for 1-2 minutes. Flip the tortilla and cook for 1-2 more minutes, until golden brown. Cut your quesadilla into triangles.",

        "Prepare the salad: Whisk together the remaining 3 tbsp olive oil, lime juice, and honey (or combine in a shaker). Toss the dressing in a large bowl with the romaine lettuce. Serve each quesadilla along with 2 cups salad."
