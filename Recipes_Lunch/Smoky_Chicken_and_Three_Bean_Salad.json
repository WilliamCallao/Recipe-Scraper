        "Spoon the honey mixture over the chicken. Cover the skillet with a lid, lower the heat to medium, and cook for 5 minutes, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 170° F.",
        "While the chicken finishes cooking, place the green beans in a large microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 2 minutes.",

        "Divide the chicken-and-bean salad mixture into 4 servings (3 cups each) and spoon onto individual romaine leaves to create lettuce “boats.” Or place 1 cup of chopped romaine on each plate, topping each with 3 cups of the chicken mixture."
