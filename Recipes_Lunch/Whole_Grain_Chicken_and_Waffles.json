        "In another bowl, whip the remaining 3 egg whites to stiff peaks.",
        "Mix the wet ingredients into dry ingredients until combined. Gently fold in the whipped egg whites until combined. Cook the waffles according to your waffle iron instructions. For 4-inch square waffles, each waffle uses 1/2 cup batter. Cook the waffles until they are dark golden brown.",
