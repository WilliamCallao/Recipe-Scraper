        "Place the soup in a large saucepan and season with the salt and pepper, to taste.",
        "Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the soup is thickened and the volume has been reduced by about a third.",
        "Garnish the soup with the remaining tarragon leaves. Refrigerate and serve chilled. (If preferred, serve warm.)"
