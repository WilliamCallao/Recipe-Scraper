Stack the ingredients as follows, one on top of the other on the side of the paper closest to you: 1 lettuce leaf, 1 piece of tofu, some carrot, cucumber, sprouts, and 2 mint leaves, one beside the other.",
        "Fold the side of the paper that is farthest from you over the filling tightly. Be careful not to tear it. Fold in the sides, and roll all the way to the end. Repeat this step with the remaining ingredients."
