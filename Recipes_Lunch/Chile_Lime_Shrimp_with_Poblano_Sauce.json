        "Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and preheat the broiler on high. Broil the poblano pepper until slightly blackened, for about 5 minutes, turning a couple of times. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to steam for 5 minutes.",
        "Once it’s cool enough to touch, peel off the skin. Remove the stem and slice the pepper open to remove the seeds and roughly chop the pepper.",
        "Toss the shrimp with ½ tablespoon olive oil, 1 garlic clove, peppers, and pepper.  Let it marinate for 15-30 minutes",
        "While the shrimp is marinating, finish the sauce. Blend the poblano pepper, Greek yogurt, 2 grated garlic cloves, cumin, kosher salt, and pepper in a food processor until smooth.",
        "Heat the remaining ½ tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet. Once the pan is hot, sear the shrimp for 2 minutes on each side until just cooked through.",
        "Serve with the poblano sauce."
