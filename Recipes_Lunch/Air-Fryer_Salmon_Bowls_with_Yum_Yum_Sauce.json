        "To make the salmon: Add 1 tsp Splenda Stevia Sweetener, 1/2 tsp ginger, and pomegranate juice to a sealable bag. Add salmon filets, zipping the bag tightly, and gently massage around to make sure all the flavor combines with the salmon filets. Set aside to marinate for 10 minutes.",
        "Spray the air fryer with non-stick spray and carefully add salmon filets. Cook salmon 400 degrees F for 7–9 minutes, depending on thickness (be careful not to overcook!).",
        "To make the yum yum sauce: Stir together 2 tsp sweetener, 1/2 tsp ginger, and all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Test the sauce to see if it needs any more ginger, garlic, or Splenda Stevia Sweetener and adjust accordingly.",
        "Add a tablespoon of water at a time to thin out the sauce until it is a drizzling consistency. Set aside to let the flavors combine completely.",
        "To assemble the bowl: Spray the inside of the air fryer with non-stick cooking spray. Add asparagus and give them a coating of non-stick cooking spray. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper if desired. Cook in the air fryer at 400 degrees F for 4–5 minutes.",
        "Divide rice between two bowls. Top each with a 3-ounce salmon filet, then lay 4 ounces of the cooked asparagus to the side of the bowl. Sprinkle on green onions. Add sesame seeds and chunks of avocado if desired. Drizzle on yum yum sauce. Enjoy immediately."
