        "Coat a grill rack from an outdoor gas grill with cooking spray and set it 6 inches from the heat source. Preheat the grill to medium high. If you think your shrimp will fall through the grilling rack, prepare a fish basket to grill the shrimp. Coat the inside of the basket with cooking spray.",
        "Drizzle the shrimp with the olive oil. Combine the cumin, chili powder, coriander, salt, and black pepper and rub onto the shrimp.",
        "Add the shrimp directly to the grill rack or place in a single layer in the fish basket. Grill the shrimp for about 2 to 3 minutes per side or until cooked through. Meanwhile, add the lemon halves, cut side down, to the grill, and grill for 3 to 4 minutes, just until the lemon is slightly charred.",
        "Add the grilled shrimp to a platter. Garnish with the grilled lemon halves and minced parsley."
