        "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof Dutch oven or similar pan.

Add in the onion, sweet potatoes, shallots, and garlic and sauté for 2–3 minutes.",

Add in the chicken broth, wine, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and add in the mushrooms.",
        "Transfer the pan to the oven and bake uncovered for 40–45 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Sprinkle with parsley."
