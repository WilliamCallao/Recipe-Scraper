    "instructions": [
        "To make the peach BBQ sauce:Heat 1 1/2 tsp oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 2–3 minutes. Stir in peaches and cook for 5 minutes. Add ketchup, apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup sweetener, Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 tsp salt, and garlic powder and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until peaches break down and sauce begins to thicken, about 10–15 minutes. Carefully transfer peach mixture to blender and blend until smooth, about 1 minute.",
        "To make the chicken:Heat grill to medium and brush grates with oil. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Grill chicken, flipping occasionally and brushing with peach BBQ sauce until fully cooked and a meat thermometer reaches 165 degrees F, about 8–10 minutes. Transfer to plate and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.",
        "To make the salad:Grill peach halves, cut side down, until char marks appear, about 1–2 minutes. Slice peach halves into ½-inch thick slices.",
        "Whisk 2 tbsp olive oil, lemon juice, 2 tsp sweetener, 1/8 tsp salt, and pepper together in large bowl until combined. Add grilled peach slices, arugula, and red onion and toss to coat. Serve grilled chicken with salad and enjoy."
