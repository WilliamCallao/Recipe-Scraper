        "Prepare the ingredients & make the glaze: Wash and dry the fresh produce.  Peel 1 clove of garlic; using a zester, finely grate into a paste (or use the small side of a box grater). Peel the carrots and thinly slice on an angle. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then quarter lengthwise. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy; roughly chop. Peel and finely chop the ginger.  Halve the orange crosswise; squeeze the juice into a medium bowl. Add the ponzu sauce, honey, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Whisk to thoroughly combine.",
        "Form the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the turkey, garlic paste, and breadcrumbs; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Gently mix to combine. Shape the mixture into 10 tightly packed meatballs. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Cook the vegetables: In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat the sesame oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced carrots and quartered peppers; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped bok choy and chopped ginger. Season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Transfer to a bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Brown the meatballs:  In the same pan, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium until hot. Add the meatballs in an even layer. Loosely cover the pan with foil and cook, without stirring, 6 minutes, or until browned. Flip the meatballs. Cover and continue to cook 6 minutes, or until browned.",
        "Glaze the meatballs & serve your dish:  To the pan, add the glaze (carefully, as the liquid may splatter); season with salt (optional)and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently and spooning the glaze over the meatballs, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the glaze is slightly thickened and the meatballs are coated and cooked through.* Turn off the heat. Serve the glazed meatballs over the cooked vegetables. Garnish with the furikake (if using). Enjoy! * An instant-read thermometer should register 165°F."
