        "Place egg in a pan just large enough to hold it. Add enough cold water to cover egg by 1 inch. Bring to a boil. Once the water comes to a boil, watch carefully. Boil 30 seconds to 1 minute. Turn heat off and cover. (Let sit 18 minutes. Note: Boiling the egg too long results in a green ring around the yolk; however, it is still safe to eat.)",
        "Mix together the tomato, corn, scallion, parsley, olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Set aside to let the flavors blend. This can be done ahead of time.",
        "Toast the bread and place it on a large plate. Lay the spinach on top of the bread.",
        "Slice the egg into 5–6 slices and lay them on top of the spinach. Spoon the tomato corn mixture onto the sandwich and serve."
