        "In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, Neufchâtel, and honey until thick and creamy. Spread the crème onto a serving platter or board.",
        "Prepare and preheat a grill or grill pan. Brush the cut side of the strawberry halves with the oil and grill over direct medium-high heat, cut-side down, until rich grill marks form, about 4 minutes.",
        "Arrange the strawberries on the crème. Drizzle with the balsamic glaze, sprinkle with the almonds and fresh herbs, and serve.",
        "*Make your own balsamic reduction sauce: Add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring a couple times, until it can just coat the back of a spoon (to yield about 1 1/2 tablespoons), about 5 minutes. (Note: The balsamic reduction thickens slightly as it cools.)"
