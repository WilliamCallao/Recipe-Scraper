    "instructions": [
        "To make the BBQ sauce: Combine 3/4 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 salt, and all other sauce ingredients into a small saucepan and heat to medium-low. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes to allow flavors to develop. Stir occasionally. Remove from heat and set aside. BBQ sauce will thicken as it cools.",
        "To make the wings: Preheat air fryer to 375 degrees F. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 onion powder, 1/8 tsp salt, and pepper. Pour in milk and stir to form a batter. (If batter is too thin, add a little more flour and stir. Batter should be thick enough to hold to the cauliflower florets.) Add in cauliflower florets and toss to coat each piece evenly.",
        "Spray basket of air fryer with nonstick cooking spray. Using tongs, place each batter-covered floret into the basket. It’s best to work in two batches so you don’t overcrowd the air fryer. Air-fry each batch for 7 minutes, then remove and brush cauliflower wings with BBQ Sauce. Return to air fryer another 1–2 minutes until crispy.",
        "Remove and repeat for the next batch. Toss all crispy BBQ wings in more sauce. Serve alongside the rest of the BBQ sauce and ranch dressing if desired. Enjoy!"
