        "Prepare the ingredients: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Separate the kale leaves from the stems; discard the stems, then thinly slice the leaves. Peel 1 clove of garlic; using the flat side of your knife, smash the clove once. Quarter, core, and thinly slice the pear. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then medium dice.",
        "Marinate the kale: In a large bowl, combine the salsa verde, fromage blanc, and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Add the sliced kale. Using your hands, massage the kale until slightly softened. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes.",
        "Make the parmesan breadcrumbs: Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the breadcrumbs and smashed garlic clove; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the breadcrumbs are browned and toasted. Transfer to a bowl; carefully remove and discard the garlic clove. Add the parmesan and stir to combine. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Combine onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and dried parsley into a small bowl and stir to create spice blend. Season chicken on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In the same pan, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Turn off the heat.",
        "Make the salad & serve your dish: To the bowl of marinated kale, add the sliced pear and diced peppers; toss to combine. Serve the salad topped with the cooked chicken and parmesan breadcrumbs. Enjoy!"
