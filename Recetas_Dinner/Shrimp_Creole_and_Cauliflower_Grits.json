        "For the grits: Heat oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower and cook until softened and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.",
        "Add the beans, broth, and water. Cook for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Add the Parmesan and onion powder. Using a masher or blender, mix until just creamy with a little texture remaining. Add more water as needed. Season with pepper. Cover to keep warm until serving.",
        "For the shrimp: Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel. Heat 1½ tsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the shrimp in a single layer. Lightly sear on one side until curled and lightly charred. Remove shrimp to a plate and add the remaining oil to the pan.",
        "Add the celery, onion, and bell pepper to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally until tender but not overly browned, about 7 minutes. If the pan gets too dry while the vegetables cook, add water as needed.",
        "Add the garlic and seasoning and heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, broth, and bay leaf. Use a spoon to scrape any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes until thickened, stir frequently to prevent the bottom from burning.",
