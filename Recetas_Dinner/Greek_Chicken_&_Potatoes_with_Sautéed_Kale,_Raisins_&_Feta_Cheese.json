        "Prepare & roast the potatoes: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Line a sheet pan with foil. Cut the potatoes into 1/2-inch-wide wedges. Place on the sheet pan; drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and season with salt (optional), pepper, and the oregano. Toss to coat and arrange in an even layer, skin side down. Roast 21 to 23 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Prepare the remaining ingredients: Meanwhile, separate the kale leaves from the stems; discard the stems, then roughly chop the leaves.Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Halve the lemon crosswise; squeeze the juice into a large bowl, straining out the seeds. Roughly chop the peppers and olives. Combine in a bowl; add 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and stir to coat.",
        "Cook the kale: In the pan of reserved fond, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped kale and chopped garlic; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the kale is slightly wilted. Add the raisins and 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter); season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the kale is wilted and the water has cooked off. Turn off the heat. Add the cheese (crumbling before adding) and stir to combine.",
        "Cook the chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board.",
        "Finish & serve your dish: Add the roasted potatoes to the bowl of lemon juice; stir to coat. Slice the cooked chicken crosswise. Serve the sliced chicken with the finished potatoes and cooked kale. Top the chicken with the pepper-olive mixture. Enjoy!"
