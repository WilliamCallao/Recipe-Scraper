        "Prepare the ingredients: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; thinly slice on an angle. Separate the kale leaves from stems; discard the stems, then roughly chop the leaves. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic.",
        "Cook & finish the couscous: In a medium pot, combine the couscous and 3/4 cup of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, turn off the heat. Cover and let stand 6 to 8 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the couscous is tender. Fluff with a fork. Add the pesto; stir to combine.",
        "Cook the vegetables: Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced carrots; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped kale and chopped garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the kale is slightly wilted. Add the currants and 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale is wilted and the water has cooked off. Turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar. Transfer to a bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the chicken & serve your dish: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the Italian seasoning to coat (you may have extra). In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.** Transfer to a cutting board; slice crosswise. Serve the sliced chicken with the cooked vegetables and finished couscous. Enjoy! **An instant-read thermometer should register 165Â°F."
