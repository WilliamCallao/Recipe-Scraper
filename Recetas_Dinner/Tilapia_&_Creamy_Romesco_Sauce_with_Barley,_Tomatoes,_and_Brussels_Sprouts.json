        "Cook the barley: Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the barley and cook, uncovered, 28 to 30 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.",
        "Prepare the ingredients: Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the brussels sprouts; halve lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. In a bowl, combine the romesco sauce and fromage blanc; season with salt (optional) and pepper.",
        "Cook the vegetables: In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the tomatoes. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened and blistered. Add the sliced white bottoms of the scallions, sliced brussels sprouts, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened. Add the vinegar (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently and gently pressing the tomatoes with the back of a spoon, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a bowl; cover with foil to keep warm. Rinse and wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the fish: Pat the fish dry with paper towels. Season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and the oregano. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fish. Cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until lightly browned and cooked through.* Turn off the heat. * An instant-read thermometer should register 145°F.",
        "Finish the barley & serve your dish: To the pot of cooked barley, add the cooked vegetables and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil; stir to combine. Serve the finished barley topped with the cooked fish and creamy romesco sauce. Garnish with the sliced green tops of the scallions. Enjoy!"
