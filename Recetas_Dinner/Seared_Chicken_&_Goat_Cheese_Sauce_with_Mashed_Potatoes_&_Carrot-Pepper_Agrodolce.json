        "Prepare the ingredients & make the sauce:  Remove the honey and cheese from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Medium dice the potatoes. Peel the carrots; halve lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then quarter lengthwise. In a bowl, whisk together the cheese and 2 tablespoons of hot water. Prepare the spice blend: combine the onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and parsley in a small bowl.",
        "Cook & mash the potatoes:  Add the diced potatoes to the pot of boiling water. Cook 16 to 18 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Using a fork or potato masher, mash to your desired consistency. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Cover to keep warm.",
        "Cook the chicken:  Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.* Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board. Cover with foil to keep warm. * An instant-read thermometer should register 165°F.",
        "Make the carrot-pepper agrodolce:  In the pan of reserved fond, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the carrot pieces; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until lightly browned and slightly softened. Add the quartered peppers. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the honey, vinegar (carefully, as the liquid may splatter), raisins, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the vegetables are coated. Turn off the heat.",
        "Slice the chicken & serve your dish: Slice the cooked chicken crosswise. Serve the sliced chicken with the mashed potatoes and carrot-pepper agrodolce. Top the chicken with the sauce. Enjoy!"
