        "Prepare the ingredients & start the sauce. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the brussels sprouts; quarter lengthwise. Peel the carrots; halve lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Cut off and discard the ends of the turnip; medium dice. Combine in a large bowl. Core and medium dice the apple. Pick the sage leaves off the stems; thinly slice the leaves. In a bowl, combine the mustard , maple syrup, and 1/4 cup of water. Season with salt (optional) and pepper.",
        "Roast the vegetables. Line a sheet pan with foil. In a small bowl, combine ground yellow mustard, smoked paprika, sweet paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder to create spice blend. To the bowl of prepared vegetables, add a 1/2 tsp of olive oil and season with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). Toss to coat. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan and arrange in an even layer. Roast 20 to 22 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Cook the chicken & apple. Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides. In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 tsp of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 6 to 8 minutes, or until lightly browned. Flip the chicken and add the diced apple. Cook, stirring the apple occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, or until the apple is softened and the chicken is cooked through (an instant-read thermometer should register 165°F). Leaving the apple in the pan, transfer the cooked chicken to a plate.",
        "Finish the sauce & serve your dish. Add the sauce (carefully, as the liquid may splatter), and sliced sage leaves to the pan of cooked apple. Season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the apple is thoroughly coated. Turn off the heat. Serve the cooked chicken with the roasted vegetables. Top the chicken with the finished sauce and apple. Enjoy!"
