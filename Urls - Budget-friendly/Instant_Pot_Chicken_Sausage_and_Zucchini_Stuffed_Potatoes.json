Add 1/3 cup of the water, the zucchini, 3/4 cup of the onion and oregano, cook 3 minutes or until zucchini is tender crisp, scraping up browned bits.  Place in a medium bowl with hot sauce and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Cover to keep warm.",
        "Put a steamer basket in the pressure cooking pot and add the remaining water. Top with the potatoes. Lock the lid in place and close the seal valve. Press the Cancel button and reset to Manual for 18 minutes. When time ends, use a 10-minute natural pressure release, then a quick pressure release.",
        "When valve drops, carefully remove the lid. Remove potatoes with tongs (or a fork). Split potatoes almost in half and fluff with a fork. Add the salt and pepper to the sausage mixture and spoon equal amounts over each potato. Top with the cheese and remaining 1/4 cup green onion."
