        "In another bowl, add almond butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, remaining lime juice, and pumpkin spice. Mix together.",
        "Remove apples from water and pat dry. Stuff each apple with 1 tablespoon almond butter mixture. Once all apples are stuffed, place them in a deep baking dish. Add about 1/2 inch water to the baking dish, and make sure apples are upright in the water. (The water keeps the apples from drying out.) Bake for 1 hour. While the apples bake, keep an eye on the water level; add more water if needed.",
        "Once apples are fork tender, remove from baking dish and serve."
