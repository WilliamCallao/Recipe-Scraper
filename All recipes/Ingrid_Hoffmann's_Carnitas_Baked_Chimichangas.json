Place the pork in the pan and broil, 6 inches from the source of heat, turning occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer reads 145 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part of the pork, about 15 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the pork rest for 10 minutes.",

        "Preheat a baking sheet for 5 minutes in the oven. Remove with oven mittens and place the chimichangas, seam-side down, on the baking sheet. Spray with nonstick spray. Bake for 15 minutes, until golden brown."
