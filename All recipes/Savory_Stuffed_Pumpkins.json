Pour the water over the pumpkins and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the pumpkins from the pan and set them aside to cool slightly. Discard the water.",
        "While the pumpkins are cooking, coat a small sauté pan with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Add the onion and celery and sauté for about 7 minutes, until softened; set aside to cool.",
        "In a medium bowl, combine the remaining ingredients and mix until the bread is coated and has started to soften. Stir in the onion and celery mixture.",
        "Place the pumpkins cut side up in the baking dish and gently scoop out the seeds, taking care not to remove too much of the pumpkin flesh. Divide the filling mixture evenly among the pumpkins and cap with the pumpkin tops. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the tops and bake 10 more minutes. If desired, serve with the tops."
