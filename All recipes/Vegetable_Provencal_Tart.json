        "Coat large nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray and set over medium-high heat until hot. Reduce heat to medium-low and sauté onion until very soft and golden, about 20 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and sauté for another 5 minutes. Transfer to plate.",
        "Preheat oven to 400°F. Mix flour, thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Stir in water and oil, just until a soft dough forms. Lightly sprinkle work surface with flour and roll out dough with a rolling pin into a 16 × 10-inch rectangle or 13-inch round. Fold in half and transfer to 12 × 6-inch tart pan or 9-inch round tart pan with removable bottom. Trim the edges. Spread the Dijon mustard evenly over the bottom of the tart with the back of a spoon.",
        "Lightly coat skillet again with nonstick cooking spray and set over medium heat. Add zucchini to the skillet with 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and sauté until golden, 5–7 minutes.",
        "Arrange a layer of tomatoes, followed by the zucchini, another layer of the remaining tomatoes, and the onion, overlapping them slightly on the bottom of the tart. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and the Parmesan cheese. Bake for about 20 minutes until tart is a lightly golden brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the top with the basil and return to the oven for 3 more minutes. Let the tart cool for 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve."
