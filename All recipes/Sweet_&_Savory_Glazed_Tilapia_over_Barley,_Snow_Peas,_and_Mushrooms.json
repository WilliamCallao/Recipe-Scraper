        "Cook the barley: Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the barley. Cook, uncovered, 28 to 30 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.",
        "Prepare the ingredients & make the glaze: Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Halve the cucumber lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise. Place in a bowl and add half the vinegar; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Stir to combine. Cut the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces. Halve the snow peas crosswise. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. In a bowl, whisk together the miso paste, maple syrup, remaining vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of water.",
        "Cook the vegetables: In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat half the sesame oil on medium-high until hot. Add the mushroom pieces in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned. Add the halved peas, chopped garlic, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Add the coconut aminos. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the liquid has cooked off. Transfer to a bowl; cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook & glaze the fish: Pat the fish dry with paper towels; season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat the remaining sesame oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fish. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, constantly spooning the glaze over the fish, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the fish is coated and cooked through.* Turn off the heat. * An instant-read thermometer should register 145°F.",
        "Finish the barley & serve your dish: Add the cooked vegetables to the pot of cooked barley; stir to combine. Serve the finished barley topped with the glazed fish (including any glaze from the pan). Garnish with the dressed cucumber. Enjoy!"
