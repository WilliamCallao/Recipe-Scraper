When the oven is hot, add 2 tsp. of the vegetable oil to a 9-inch cast-iron skillet. Heat the pan in the oven for 5 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and caraway seeds.",
        "In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a wire whisk. Add the buttermilk, honey, and the 1/4 cup vegetable oil.",
        "Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.",
        "Carefully add the batter to the hot skillet and bake for 20 to 22 minutes, or until the cornbread is cooked through and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let the cornbread cool for 5 minutes. Cut into 16 same-sized wedges and serve warm."
