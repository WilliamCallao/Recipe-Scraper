Cover with aluminum foil and bake until a fork can pierce the beets with ease, about 1 hour. Remove the baking dish from the oven and allow the beets to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the skin and cut the beets into ¼-inch slices.",
        "Zest the lemon half (set the zest aside), then use a paring knife to remove the remaining skin and pith (white part) of the halved lemon. Cut in between the membranes to release the lemon segments, and then chop.",
        "In a medium bowl, combine the canola oil and cumin. Add the beets, lemon zest, chopped lemon, onion, dill, salt, and pepper and gently toss together. Transfer to a serving dish and serve warm."
