        "Place all dry ingredients in the bowl of your food processor. Pulse a few times to blend well.",
        "With the machine running, add 1 cup of water in a slow and steady stream. The dough should form a ball and clean the sides of the food processor. If it seems too dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. The dough is perfect when it is no longer sticky and feels smooth. If it is too sticky or wet, you can add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time.",
        "Place dough in a large bowl with extra virgin olive oil. Turn dough to completely cover with oil and then cover tightly with plastic wrap and a cloth towel.",
        "Let dough rise in a warm place for at least one hour. A good place to rise is in the oven with the oven off and the oven light on.",
        "After the dough doubles in size, punch it down and let it rise again for as long as possible, at least one hour. I am a huge fan of the longer rise for lighter dough, especially when using whole-wheat flour."
