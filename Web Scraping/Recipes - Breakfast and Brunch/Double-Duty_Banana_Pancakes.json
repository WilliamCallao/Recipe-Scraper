        "Mash one half of the banana slices and place in a medium bowl with the pancake mix and the milk. Stir until just blended.",
        "Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. (To test, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If the water drops “dance” or jump in the pan, it’s hot enough.) Coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray, add two scant 1/4 cup measures of batter, and cook the pancakes until puffed and dry around the edges, about 1 minute.",
        "Flip the pancakes and cook until golden on the bottom. Place on a plate and cover to keep warm.",
        "Recoat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray, add three scant 1/4 cup measures of batter, and cook as directed. Repeat with the remaining batter.",
        "Place 2 pancakes on each of 4 dinner plates, top with equal amounts of banana slices, and drizzle evenly with the syrup. If you like, place the dinner plates in a warm oven and add the pancakes as they are cooked."
