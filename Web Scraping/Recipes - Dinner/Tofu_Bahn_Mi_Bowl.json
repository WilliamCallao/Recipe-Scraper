Put another plate on top of those towels and place something heavy on the top of the stack. Let sit for at least a few minutes to remove some of the water from the tofu.",

        "Prepare the bowls: Divide the cabbages between two large bowls. Top each with half the cucumber slices and 4 slices tofu. Drain the pickled carrot and radish, and top each bowl with half the pickled vegetables. Drizzle half the dressing over each bowl, then garnish each with cilantro, basil, and peanuts."
