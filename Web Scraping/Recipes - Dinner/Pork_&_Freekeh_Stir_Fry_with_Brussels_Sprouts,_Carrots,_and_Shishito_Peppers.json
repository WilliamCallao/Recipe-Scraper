    "instructions": [
        "Cook the freekah:  Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the freekeh and cook, uncovered, 24 to 26 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly.",
        "Prepare the remaining ingredients & make the sauce: Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; thinly slice on an angle. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the brussels sprouts; quarter lengthwise. Combine in a bowl.  Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; cut into 1-inch pieces. Combine in a bowl. Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately after handling the peppers.  Halve the lime crosswise; squeeze the juice into a medium bowl. Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Whisk to thoroughly combine.",
        "Cook the pork: Pat the pork dry with paper towels; season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides.  In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot.  Add the seasoned pork. Cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.  Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board. Carefully cut into bite-sized pieces.",
        "Start the stir-fry: In the pan of reserved fond, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot.  Add the prepared carrots and brussels sprouts in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Add 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the water has cooked off. Add the prepared pepper mixture; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened.",
        "Finish the stir-fry & serve your dish: Add the cooked freekeh, pork pieces, and sauce to the pan. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until combined and the sauce is slightly thickened. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.  Serve the finished stir-fry garnished with the sesame seeds. Enjoy!"
