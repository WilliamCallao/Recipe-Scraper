        "Prepare the ingredients & make the dressing: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut out and discard the core of the cabbage; medium dice the leaves. Place in a large bowl; add half the vinegar and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Season with salt (optional) and pepper; stir to coat. Halve the cucumbers lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Place in a separate bowl; add the remaining vinegar and season with salt (optional) and pepper. Stir to coat. Medium dice the zucchini. Peel the carrots. Halve lengthwise; cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Peel and finely chop the ginger. In a bowl, whisk together the ponzu sauce and ranch dressing.",
        "Cook the chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 5 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.* Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board. * An instant-read thermometer should register 165Â°F.",
        "Cook & finish the vegetables: In the pan of reserved fond, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced zucchini and carrot pieces in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the chopped ginger and half the togarashi; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to the bowl of dressed cabbage; stir to combine.",
        "Slice the chicken & serve your dish: Slice the cooked chicken crosswise. Serve the finished vegetables topped with the sliced chicken and dressing. Garnish with the dressed cucumbers and remaining togarashi. Enjoy!"
