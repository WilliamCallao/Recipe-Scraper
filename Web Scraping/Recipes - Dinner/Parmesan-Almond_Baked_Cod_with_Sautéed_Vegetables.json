        "Prepare the ingredients: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut the zucchini into 1/2-inch rounds. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then quarter lengthwise. Halve the tomatoes. Roughly chop the almonds. Place in a bowl; add the parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and parsley. Season with salt (optional) and pepper.",
        "Prepare and bake the fish: Line a sheet pan with foil, then lightly oil the center of the foil. Pat the fish dry with paper towels; season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides. Transfer to the oiled portion of the foil. Evenly spread the fromage blanc onto the fish, then top with the parmesan-almond mixture (pressing gently to adhere). Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until the topping is browned and the fish is cooked through.* Remove from the oven. *An instant-read thermometer should register 145°F.",
        "Cook the Zucchini: Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the zucchini rounds in an even layer; season with salt and pepper. Cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until browned and softened. Transfer to a bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the remaining vegetables and serve your dish: In the same pan, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced peppers; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add 1/4 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter) and season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the water has cooked off. Add the halved tomatoes and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until combined. Turn off the heat. Stir in the worcestershire sauce until combined. Serve the baked fish with the cooked vegetables. Enjoy!"
