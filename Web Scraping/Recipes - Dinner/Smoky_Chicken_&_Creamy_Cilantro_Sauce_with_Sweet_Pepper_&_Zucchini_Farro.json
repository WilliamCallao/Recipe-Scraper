        "Cook the farro: Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the farro and cook, uncovered, 18 to 20 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.",
        "Prepare the ingredients: Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Medium dice the zucchini. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Cut off and discard the stems of the sweet peppers; remove the cores, then large dice. Roughly chop the sweet drop peppers. To make the creamy cilantro pesto, in a bowl, combine the cilantro sauce and fromage blanc. To make the dressing, in a separate bowl, combine the honey, vinegar, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Season with salt (optional) and pepper.  To make the spice blend, combine the smoked and sweet paprika, mustard powder, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small bowl.",
        "Cook the vegetables: In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced zucchini in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until browned. Add the chopped garlic and diced sweet peppers. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a bowl; cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.* Transfer to a cutting board. Carefully slice crosswise.  *An instant-read thermometer should register 165 degrees F.",
        "Finish the farro & serve your dish: To the pot of cooked farro, add the dressing, chopped sweet drop peppers, cooked vegetables, and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Season with salt (optional) and pepper; stir to combine. Serve the finished farro topped with the sliced chicken. Drizzle with the creamy cilantro sauce. Enjoy!"
