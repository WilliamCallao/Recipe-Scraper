        "Prepare the ingredients & make the relish. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Halve the zucchini lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Cut off and discard the stems of the sweet peppers; remove the cores. Thinly slice into rings. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Roughly chop the piquante peppers. Peel and medium dice the orange. In a bowl, combine the diced orange, chopped piquante peppers, and a 1/2 tsp of olive oil; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes.",
        "Cook the couscous. Meanwhile, in a medium pot, combine the couscous, a big pinch of salt (optional), and 3/4 cup of water; heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, turn off the heat. Cover and let stand 6 to 8 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the couscous is tender. Fluff with a fork.",
        "Cook the vegetables & finish the couscous. Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a 1/2 tsp of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced zucchini in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sliced sweet peppers and chopped garlic; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to the pot of cooked couscous; stir in the salsa verde. Taste, then season with salt (optional) and pepper if desired. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the salmon & serve your dish. Pat the fish dry with paper towels. Transfer to a cutting board, skin side down. Cut into two equal-sized pieces; season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you'd like, depending on how spicy you'd like the dish to be. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium until hot. Add the seasoned fish, skin side up. Loosely cover the pan with foil. Cook 3 to 5 minutes on the first side, or until lightly browned. Flip and cook 2 to 4 minutes, or until browned and cooked through. Turn off the heat. Serve the cooked salmon over the finished couscous. Garnish with the relish. Enjoy!"
