        "Prepare the ingredients & start the dressing:  Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Medium dice the potatoes. Peel 2 cloves of garlic. Using a zester, finely grate 1 clove into a paste (or use the small side of a box grater). Using the flat side of your knife, smash the remaining clove once. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the green beans. Roughly chop the almonds. In a large bowl, combine the chopped almonds, vinegar, 2 teaspoons of olive oil, and as much of the garlic paste as you’d like; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Combine the ground fennel, fennel seeds, ground rosemary, and ground sage in a small bowl.",
        "Cook & mash the potatoes:  Add the diced potatoes and smashed garlic clove to the pot of boiling water. Cook 16 to 18 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot. Add the broth. Using a fork or potato masher, mash to your desired consistency. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Cover to keep warm.",
        "Roast the vegetables:  Meanwhile, place the prepared green beans on a sheet pan; drizzle with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and season with salt (optional) and pepper. Toss to coat.  Arrange in an even layer on one side of the sheet pan. Place the tomatoes on the other side of the sheet pan. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and season with salt (optional) and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast 10 to 12 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Cook the pork: Meanwhile, pat the pork dry with paper towels; season on both sides with pepper and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned pork. Cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.* Transfer to a plate and let rest at least 5 minutes. * An instant-read thermometer should register 145°F.",
        "Dress the green beans & serve your dish: While the pork rests, carefully transfer the roasted tomatoes to the bowl of dressing. Using a fork, smash the tomatoes to release their liquid. Stir to combine. Add the roasted green beans and stir to coat. Serve the rested pork with the mashed potatoes and dressed green beans. Enjoy!"
