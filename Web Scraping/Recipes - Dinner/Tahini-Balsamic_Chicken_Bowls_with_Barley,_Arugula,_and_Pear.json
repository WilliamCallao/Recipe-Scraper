        "Cook the barley: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450Â°F. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the barley and cook, uncovered, 28 to 30 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.",
        "Prepare the ingredients & make the dressing: Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard any stems from the fennel, then halve, core, and medium dice the bulb. Halve and peel the onion; cut into 1-inch-wide wedges, separating the layers. Quarter, core, and thinly slice the pear. In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar, tahini, 2 teaspoons of water, and the mustard; season with salt (optional) and pepper.",
        "Roast the vegetables: Place the diced fennel and onion wedges on a sheet pan. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons of olive oil and season with salt (optional) and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 16 to 18 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Cook the chicken: Meanwhile, Combine the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and dried parsley in a small bowl. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season on both sides with pepper and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Transfer to a cutting board.",
        "Finish & serve your dish: To the pot of cooked barley, add the roasted vegetables, 1 tablespoon of the dressing, and 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Season with salt (optional) and pepper; stir to combine. In a large bowl, combine the arugula and sliced pear. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Chop the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces. Serve the finished barley topped with the seasoned arugula and pear and chopped chicken. Drizzle with the remaining dressing. Enjoy!"
