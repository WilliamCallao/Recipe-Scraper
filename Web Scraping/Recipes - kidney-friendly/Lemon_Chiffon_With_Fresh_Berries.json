        "Place lemon juice and sugar substitute in saucepan. Heat and stir until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat.",
        "Crack eggs into the bowl and whisk well. Slowly pour the lemon sugar mix into the eggs while whisking. Whisk for 1 minute, then return the egg mixture to the saucepan.",
        "Whisk and cook on low to medium for several minutes until the egg mixture thickens. (The more you whisk, the lighter the mixture will be.) This will take 2-5 minutes depending on your equipment. The mixture is ready to be removed from heat when it coats the back of a spoon.",
        "Refrigerate for one hour or more. It will thicken more as it cools.",
        "Place some of the lemon chiffon in a dessert glass or bowl and spoon berries over top. Alternate layers of lemon cream and berries. Top with berries."
