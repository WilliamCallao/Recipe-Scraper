Carefully loosen the skin from the turkey breast by gently inserting your fingers between the skin and the meat, making a pocket for the orange zest mixture. Don't break the skin. Discard any fat beneath the skin. Still working carefully, spread the orange zest mixture under the loosened skin as evenly as possible. Transfer the turkey to the rack in the pan.",
        "Roast the turkey for 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 170° F. Be sure the thermometer doesn't touch the bone.",
        "Remove the turkey from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes.",
        "Discard the skin and all visible fat. Slice the turkey and serve."
