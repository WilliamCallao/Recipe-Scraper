Bring to a boil again and boil for 10 minutes. Drain and toss with 1 teaspoon olive oil before adding to the sheet pan. **This step is optional and helps reduce the potassium content of the potatoes for people on a potassium-restricted diet.",
        "Spray a 9 x13-inch sheet pan with cooking spray. Place the raw chicken strips down 1/3 of the pan. Place the potatoes down another 1/3 of the pan. Finally, lay the frozen green beans down the last 1/3 of the pan.",
        "Melt the butter and drizzle over the entire pan of chicken, potatoes and green beans. Sprinkle Italian dressing dry mix over the entire pan.",
        "Bake for 20 to 30 minutes. Check chicken for doneness after 20 minutes and ensure it has reached a temperature of 165°F (73.9°C)."
