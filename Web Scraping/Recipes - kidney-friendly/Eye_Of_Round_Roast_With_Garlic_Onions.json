Place the roast in the center of a 13 × 9-inch baking pan, arrange onions and garlic around, and drizzle with oil. Bake 20 minutes, turning the beef and stirring the onion mixture after 10 minutes.",

Place the roast on a cutting board and let stand 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain. Stir the water into the onion mixture in the pan, scraping the bottom and sides of the pan, and place in oven while the beef is resting. Serve with beef."
