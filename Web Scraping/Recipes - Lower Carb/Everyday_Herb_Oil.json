        "Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Fill a medium bowl with ice water and set it nearby.",
        "Add the parsley, oregano, rosemary, and thyme leaves to the boiling water. Blanch the herbs for 10-15 seconds, then immediately remove the herbs with a slotted spoon and transfer them to the ice water. After a few seconds, remove the herbs from the ice water with a slotted spoon and pat them dry with paper towels.",
        "In a blender or food processor, puree the blanched herbs with the olive oil.",
        "Pour the herb oil into a dark-colored glass bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid, seal the container, and set in a cool, dark place (such as your pantry) to infuse for at least 5 days. After it has been fully infused, keep the oil in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 weeks. Or freeze the herb oil in ice cube trays for future use. (Note that each ice cube is 2 tablespoons of oil.)"
