    "instructions": [
        "Prepare & roast the vegetables: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the brussels sprouts; halve lengthwise. Peel the carrots; halve lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Peel the turnip; cut off and discard the ends, then medium dice. Combine the prepared vegetables in a large bowl. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Season with salt (optional), pepper, paprikas, mustard powder, garlic powder, and onion powder. Toss to thoroughly coat. Transfer to a sheet pan and arrange in an even layer. Roast 20 to 22 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Prepare the remaining ingredients & start the sauce: Meanwhile, core and medium dice the apple. Pick the sage leaves off the stems; thinly slice the leaves. In a bowl, combine the mustard, maple syrup, 1/4 cup of water, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Cook the pork & apple: Pat the pork dry with paper towels. Season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides. In a large pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned pork. Cook 4 to 6 minutes, or until browned. Flip the pork and move to one side of the pan; add the diced apple in an even layer to the other side. Loosely cover the pan with foil and cook, without stirring, 4 to 6 minutes, or until the apple is slightly softened and the pork is cooked through.* Leaving the apple in the pan, transfer the cooked pork to a cutting board. Let rest at least 5 minutes. * An instant-read thermometer should register 145°F.",
        "Finish the sauce & serve your dish: While the pork rests, to the pan of cooked apple, add the sauce (carefully, as the liquid may splatter) and sliced sage leaves. Cook on medium-high, stirring frequently and scraping up any fond, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the apple is softened and thoroughly coated. Turn off the heat. Slice the rested pork crosswise.  Serve the sliced pork with the roasted vegetables. Top the pork with the finished sauce. Enjoy!"
