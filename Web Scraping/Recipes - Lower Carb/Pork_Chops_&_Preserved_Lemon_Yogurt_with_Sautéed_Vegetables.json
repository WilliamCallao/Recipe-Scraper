        "Prepare the ingredients & marinate the radishes: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then quarter lengthwise. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Halve the radishes lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise; place in a medium bowl. Add the sliced green tops of the scallions and vinegar; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes.",
        "Cook the pork: Meanwhile, pat the pork dry with paper towels. Combine the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and dried parsley. Season the pork on both sides with pepper and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned pork and cook 4 to 6 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.** Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes. **An instant-read thermometer should register 145°F.",
        "Make the lemon yogurt: Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the yogurt and lemon purée; season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine.",
        "Cook the vegetables: While the pork rests, in the pan of reserved fond, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the snow peas in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the quartered peppers and sliced white bottoms of the scallions; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Turn off the heat.",
        "Slice the pork & serve your dish: Slice the rested pork crosswise. Divide the lemon yogurt between two dishes; spread into an even layer. Top with the sliced pork and cooked vegetables. Garnish with the marinated radishes and almonds. Enjoy!"
