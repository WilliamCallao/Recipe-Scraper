        "Set up a mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. If you do not have a mixer, set up a food processor.",
        "Add warm water, Splenda Brown Sugar, and yeast to the mixing bowl or food processor bowl and let the yeast bloom for 5 minutes. The yeast should begin to get frothy.",
        "Add the flour and salt (optional) and mix on low until flour is incorporated. If using a mixer with the dough hook attachment, turn the speed up to medium and knead the dough for 5 minutes. If using a food processor, turn the dough onto a clean, floured board or counter top and knead by hand for 5-7 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, add a Tbsp. of flour at a time until it forms a smooth dough.",
        "Add kneaded dough to a large bowl coated with cooking spray, cover and put in a warm place for one hour to rise.",
        "While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Set aside.",
        "In a medium sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until softened and all of the liquid from them is evaporated.",
        "In a medium bowl, combine mushrooms, spinach, garlic, salt (optional), pepper and mozzarella cheese. Set aside.",
        "Divide the dough into eight balls and let rest, covered with plastic wrap, for about 15 minutes.",
        "Roll out each dough round to 1/4 inch thickness. Add 1/8 of filling (about 1/2 cup) to each round. Fold over to form a calzone and press the edges to seal. Repeat this process for the remaining 8 hot pockets and place on the baking sheet.",
        "Brush each hot pocket with egg wash and bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown."
