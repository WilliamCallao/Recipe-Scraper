        "Whisk together the eggs, egg whites, dried mustard, sage, salt (optional), and black pepper.",
        "Coat a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Tear four pieces of the whole wheat bread into pieces and layer them on the bottom of the casserole dish. Top with 1/2 the roasted vegetables and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Pour half the egg mixture over the bread, vegetables, and cheese.",
        "Repeat the layering process with the remaining torn bread, vegetables, cheese, and egg mixture. Press down on the casserole with a spatula to ensure all of the bread soaks in the egg mixture. Let the strata sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.",
        "Bake the strata for 30 minutes.",
        "To serve, cut the strata down the middle lengthwise, then cut down the middle width-wise. Cut each half down the middle width-wise again to make 8 equal servings."
