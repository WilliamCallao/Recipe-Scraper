        "Preheat the broiler. Line a broiler pan with foil. Lightly spray the foil with nonstick spray. Place the poblanos on the pan and broil, 4 inches from the heat, turning occasionally, until the poblanos are tender and slightly charred in spots, about 8 minutes.",
        "Place the poblanos in a zip-close plastic bag; squeeze out the air and seal the bag. Let stand 15 minutes. Leave the broiler on.",
        "Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, carrots, scallions, garlic, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the basil until well mixed.",
        "Meanwhile, peal the poblanos. Make one slit to create a pocket and remove the seeds. Stuff each pepper with one-quarter of the mushroom mixture and top with 1 Tbsp of cheese.",
        "Broil the stuffed peppers, 4 inches from the heat, until the filling is hot and the cheese begins to melt, about 4 minutes."
