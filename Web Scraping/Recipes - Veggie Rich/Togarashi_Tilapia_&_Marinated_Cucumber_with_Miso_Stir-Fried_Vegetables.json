        "Prepare the ingredients & make the sauce: Remove the honey from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the green beans; halve crosswise. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy; roughly chop, separating the stems and leaves. Peel and roughly chop 2 cloves of garlic. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then quarter lengthwise. Combine in a bowl; add the chopped bok choy stems. Halve the cucumber lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Place in a bowl; add the vinegar and half the sesame oil. Stir to coat. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes. In a separate bowl, whisk together the honey (kneading the packet before opening), miso paste, remaining sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon of water.",
        "Start the stir-fry: While the cucumber marinates, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the halved green beans in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add 2 tablespoons of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the green beans are slightly softened.",
        "Finish the stir-fry: To the pan, add the prepared pepper mixture; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Add the chopped bok choy leaves and sauce. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened. Transfer to a bowl. Cover with foil to keep warm. Rinse and wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the fish & serve your dish: Pat the fish dry with paper towels. Season on both sides with salt (optional), pepper, and all but a pinch of the togarashi. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fish and cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through (an instant-read thermometer should register 145Â°F). Turn off the heat. Serve the finished stir-fry topped with the cooked fish and marinated cucumber (discarding any liquid). Garnish with the remaining togarashi. Enjoy!"
