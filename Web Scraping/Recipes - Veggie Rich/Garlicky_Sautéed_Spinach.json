        "In a large sauté pan, add remaining olive oil and a generous amount of cooking spray over medium high heat. Add the onions and sauté until just starting to caramelize.",
        "Add the roasted garlic paste and stir until the onions are coated. Add the spinach and sauté until the spinach is wilted and coated with the garlic and onions.",
