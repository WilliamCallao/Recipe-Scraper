        "In a large nonstick pan heat olive oil and sauté onions, peppers, garlic, and spices. Sauté for 3 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.",

Remove 1 cup of bean mixture and purée in a blender or food processor until a coarse purée is formed. Fold the purée back into the bean mixture. Add the cheddar cheese and cilantro, combine well. Mixture should resemble a coarse paste and be stiff enough to hold up in a scoop or spoon.",
        "With an ice cream scoop or spoon, form 3-4 ounce portions. Sprinkle a plate with cornmeal and place scooped black bean portions on plate. Lightly dust black bean mixture with cornmeal and press down gently, forming a patty.",
        "Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray a large nonstick pan with vegetable oil. Brown patty cakes for 2 minutes on each side. If pan is ovenproof, transfer to oven and bake for 15 minutes or until heated through. Or transfer patty cakes to a cookie sheet pan and bake."
