        "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large soup pot, add the sausage and cook until it’s lightly golden all over, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage from the pan, transfer to a bowl and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.",
        "Meanwhile, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan. Add the garlic and cook until it just starts to turn golden, about 2 minutes. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until it’s soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Then add the potatoes and mix well, allowing them to get hot, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, about 4 minutes.",
        "Add the cooked sausage back to the pot along with the chicken stock. Cover the pot and bring the soup to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer gently until the potatoes are just cooked and fork-tender, about 15 minutes.",
        "Add the greens and cook at a gentle simmer until the kale is bright green and wilted, about 5 minutes. If you want to prepare the soup ahead of time, hold the kale and add just 5 minutes before serving. Season with salt, black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper for heat."
