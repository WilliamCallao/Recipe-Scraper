        "Mix the espresso, onion powder, paprika, chili powder, and brown sugar together. Spread the mixture on both sides of the steak, pressing it into the meat.",
        "Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the steak and sauté for 5 minutes, watching to make sure the spices do not burn. Flip the steak and cook for another 5 minutes or until the steak reaches your desired doneness. A meat thermometer inserted into the steak should read 125° F for rare and 145° F for medium rare.",
        "Move the steak to a cutting board and pour the pan juices over it. Let it rest for 10 minutes, then slice. If you'd like to reserve some for another recipe, place in a tightly sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days."
