        "Preheat broiler. Place eggplant slices on a baking sheet. Brush with 1 Tbsp olive oil, and bake for a few minutes until tender and cooked through. Remove from oven, and set aside.",
        "Heat remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook until it releases its aroma. Do not let garlic turn brown. Stir in chopped and strained tomatoes, basil, pine nuts, 1/4 tsp salt, pepper, and pepper flakes. Stir and cover. Reduce heat to low. Simmer for 5 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, place a large piece of wax paper on a work surface. Place fish fillets on wax paper, and cover with another piece. Use a flat-edged meat hammer to pound fish until they are very thin, about 1/4 inch. Check under the wax paper from time to time to make sure that fish is not tearing. Cut each piece in half to make 4 pieces.",
        "Top each piece of fish with thin layers of the eggplant slices. (If you have extra eggplant slices, reserve them as a garnish). Starting at the wide end, roll up fish, completely encasing eggplant. Use toothpicks or skewers to secure the rolls. Slowly remove lid from tomato sauce, and add rolls to simmering sauce. Cover, and cook for 10-15 minutes, turning once, or until fish is cooked through.",
        "Transfer fish to a serving platter, remove skewers, and top with remaining sauce. Season with remaining 1/4 tsp salt, if desired. Serve remaining eggplant slices along the sides of the dish."
