        "Add the remaining olive oil to the skillet and add the onion. Sauté the onion for 5 minutes, until soft. Add the zucchini and sauté for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the oregano and sauté for 1 minute; stir in the reserved corn mixture.",
        "Divide the corn mixture among the warmed tortillas and top each taco with 2 tsp yogurt and 2 tsp Salsa Cruda.",
        "Cook’s Tip: Use your microwave to prep fresh corn! From each ear, cut off about 1 inch of the stalk end. Add up to 3 ears of corn at a time to a microwave-safe container and microwave on high for 6 minutes. Remove the corn from the microwave and let cool enough to handle. Holding onto the husk, gently squeeze and shake and the corn will come out in one fell swoop. If any silks remain, rub the cob up and down with paper toweling to remove the strands."
