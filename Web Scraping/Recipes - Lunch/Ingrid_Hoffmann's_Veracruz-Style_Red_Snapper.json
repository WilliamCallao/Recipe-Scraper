        "In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 minutes, until the onion is tender. Add the tomatoes, parsley, raisins, oregano, capers, bay leaves, jalapeño, salt and olives; bring to boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the flavors are blended and the sauce begins to bubble and thicken slightly.",
        "Spread half of the sauce evenly on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place the fish fillets on top of the sauce. Spoon the remaining sauce evenly over the fillets. Bake, uncovered, for 12 to 15 minutes, until the sauce is bubbly and the fish is opaque in the center. Remove and discard bay leaves before serving."
