        "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the mole sauce, orange zest, orange juice, garlic, and water. Coat an oven-safe sauté pan with cooking spray over medium-high heat.",
        "Sear the pork tenderloin until brown on all sides. Pour the mole sauce over the pork and cover completely with sauce. Put the pan in the oven and roast for 20 minutes, turning the pork every 5 minutes.",
        "While the pork is roasting, add the olive oil to a medium nonstick sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, and black beans, and sauté for 5 minutes or until the onions are softened.",
        "Add the bean mixture and water to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the beans to the pan and sauté until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Set aside.",
        "Add the cooking spray to another medium nonstick sauté pan over medium heat. Add the zucchini and sauté for 3-4 minutes or until the zucchini begins to soften. Add the chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, and lime juice. Sauté 2 more minutes.",
        "Let the pork tenderloin rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Slice the pork into 18 slices and toss the pieces in any remaining mole sauce.",
        "Build your plate with three slices of pork tenderloin (equaling about 3 oz.), 1/4 cup black beans, and 1/2 cup zucchini."
