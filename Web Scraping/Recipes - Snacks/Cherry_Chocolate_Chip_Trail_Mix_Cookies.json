        "Preheat oven to 350º. In a medium bowl, mash bananas with the back of a fork. Mix in almond butter until evenly incorporated. Stir in Splenda Monk Fruit Sweetener, applesauce, cinnamon, salt, and oats. Fold in cherries, chocolate chips, and pecans.",
        "Drop by spoonful's (about 2 tablespoons each) onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Press down a bit to shape the cookie, since they won’t rise nor spread.",
        "Bake for about 25 minutes, until the tops are light brown. Let cool and store in an airtight container.",
        "NOTE: Dried blueberries or raisins may be used in place of the dried cherries. Almonds or walnuts may be used in place of the pecans. These cookies make an excellent hearty, nutritious post-workout or travel snack."
