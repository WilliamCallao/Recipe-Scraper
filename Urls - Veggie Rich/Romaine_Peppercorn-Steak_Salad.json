Or pour the coarsely ground peppercorns onto a plate and firmly press both sides of each steak into them until coated. Lightly coat steaks with cooking spray.",
        "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and cook until medium rare, about 4 minutes per side. (Use your kitchen exhaust fan if steaks begin to smoke.) Sprinkle the steaks with the salt and let stand at least 5 minutes before slicing.",
        "Meanwhile, toss the salad mixture with tomatoes and dressing. Arrange salad evenly on 4 plates. Slice each steak into 10 pieces. Arrange the steak on top of the salads, sprinkle with the cheese, and serve."
