        "Meanwhile, in the large serving bowl, combine the chickpeas, cashews, and raisins with the remaining tablespoon of oil. Remove the cauliflower from the oven and toss in the chickpeas, cashews, and raisins. Return it to the oven for 10 more minutes until the cauliflower is well browned and tender. (Meanwhile, prepare the smoothies, if you are serving them.) Serve immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days.",
