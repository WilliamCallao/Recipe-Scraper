        "Add the vinegar, 1/2 cup water, salt, and sugar to a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil and stir until the salt and sugar dissolve. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove the brine from the heat.",
        "Add the bay leaf, dill, garlic, onion, and pickling spice to the brine.",
        "Carefully fill the jar with the brine, covering the Brussels sprouts completely.",
        "Place the lids on the jar and shake the jar gently to distribute the ingredients.",
        "Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 months. Before serving, remove and discard the bay leaf.",
        "Chefâ€™s Tip: Only tough vegetables, such as Brussels sprouts and carrots, need to be blanched first. Softer vegetables, such as cucumbers and zucchini, can go in the jar raw before you add the brine."
