        "Prepare the ingredients: Wash and dry the fresh produce. Halve the orange crosswise; squeeze the juice into a large bowl. Peel 1 clove of garlic; using a zester, finely grate into a paste (or use the large side of a box grater). To make the dressing, to the bowl of orange juice, add the mayonnaise, saffron, 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil, and as much of the garlic paste as youâ€™d like; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Whisk to combine. Set aside to let the saffron steep (or bloom), at least 10 minutes. Separate the kale leaves from the stems; discard the stems, then thinly slice the leaves. Halve the tomatoes. Place in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Roughly chop the roasted peppers. Cut off and discard the stems of the shishito peppers; cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Thoroughly wash your hands immediately after handling.",
        "Marinate the kale: To the bowl of dressing, add the sliced kale; season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat. Using your hands, massage the kale to slightly soften. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes.",
        "Char the shishito peppers: Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one) heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the shishito pepper pieces in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly charred. Season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe out the pan.",
        "Cook the beef: Separate the beef; pat dry with paper towels. Place in a bowl. Combine paprika, cumin, coriander, oregano, cayenne, and cinnamon in a separate small bowl to create spice blend. Season the beef with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). In the same pan, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned beef in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned and just cooked through. Turn off the heat.",
        "Make the salad & serve your dish: To the bowl of marinated kale, add the charred shishito peppers, seasoned tomatoes, and chopped roasted peppers. Stir to combine. Serve the salad topped with the cooked beef and almonds. Enjoy!"
