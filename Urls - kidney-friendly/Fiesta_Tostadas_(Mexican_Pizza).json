Put the tortillas on the baking sheets, spread a thin layer of refried beans on each (about 2 tablespoon per tortilla), and top each tortilla with about 1 tablespoon beans, 1 tablespoon avocado, 1 teaspoon corn, 1 teaspoon olives, and 1 tablespoon cheese (we like them best when spread lightly with the refried beans and not overloaded with toppings).",
        "Bake for about 10 minutes until the tortillas get browned and crunchy. (Meanwhile, make the ranch dressing and cut up the vegetables, if you are serving them.) Serve the tostadas immediately."
