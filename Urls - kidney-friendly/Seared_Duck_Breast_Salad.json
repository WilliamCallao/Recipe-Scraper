        "Add the romaine lettuce and radicchio to a bowl.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, mustard, salt, and pepper. Drizzle half of the dressing over the greens and toss to coat. Place the dressed greens on a serving platter. Arrange the orange sections on top of the greens.",
        "Remove the skin from the duck. Thinly slice the duck, then arrange the slices over the greens. Drizzle with the remaining dressing and garnish with the walnuts."
