        "Preheat the oven to 450° F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.",
        "In a medium bowl, stir together 3 Tbsp of the arrabbiata sauce, the pesto, and egg until combined. Add the turkey, oats, and Parmesan cheese and mix by hand until combined.",
        "Roll by hand into 12 loosely formed meatballs, about 3 Tbsp of mixture for each, and place on the baking pan. (Hint: Divide the meatball mixture into four equal-size portions, then make three meatballs from each portion.) Bake for 15 minutes—no need to flip the meatballs.",
        "Using a clean spoon, top each meatball with the remaining sauce, about 2 tsp per meatball. Bake until the sauce is hot and the meatballs are well done (with an internal temperature of at least 165° F), about 5 minutes more. Serve."
