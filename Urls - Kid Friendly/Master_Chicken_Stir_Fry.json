        "Heat half the vegetable oil in a large wok over high heat. When hot, turn the heat to medium high and add the chicken. Stir fry for 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. (You do not need to continuously stir the chicken as you want the chicken to develop a crust and sear.) Remove the chicken from the wok to a plate and set aside.",
        "Add the remaining oil to the wok. Add in the garlic and ginger and stir fry for 30 seconds. Add the red pepper, celery, and broccoli and stir fry for 30 seconds. Add the remaining chicken broth, cover, and steam 3 minutes.",
        "Add the chicken and stir fry for 1 minute. Add in the sauce and cook for 1 minute, coating the chicken and vegetables with the sauce. Serve immediately."
