        "Prepare the ingredients & make the sauce: Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut the potatoes into 1-inch-wide wedges. Peel the carrots; halve lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then quarter lengthwise. In a bowl, whisk together the cheese and 2 teaspoons of warm water; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Combine the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and dried parsley in a small bowl.",
        "Roast the potatoes: Place the potato wedges in a large bowl. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with salt (optional), pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). Toss to coat. Transfer to a sheet pan, skin side down. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 27 to 29 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.",
        "Cook the chicken: Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt (optional) and pepper on both sides. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken. Cook 6 to 7 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through.* Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board. Cover with foil to keep warm. * An instant-read thermometer should register 165°F.",
        "Make the carrot-pepper agrodolce: In the pan of reserved fond, heat 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the carrot pieces; season with salt (optional) and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes, or until lightly browned and slightly softened. Add the quartered peppers; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the honey, vinegar (carefully, as the liquid may splatter), raisins, and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the vegetables are thoroughly coated. Turn off the heat.",
        "Slice the chicken & serve your dish: Slice the cooked chicken crosswise. Serve the sliced chicken with the roasted potatoes and carrot-pepper agrodolce. Top the chicken with the sauce. Enjoy!"
